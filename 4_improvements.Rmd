# Report Improvements

There are several action items I could take to better refine this report before 
using it as a reference to my experience and knowledge. 

Possible improvements include...

-Correct legends on graphs
-Find a better color scale for the October baseflow trend between groundwater 
and discharge
-Plot discharge and temperature and quantify their relationship 
-Develop a better structure for what information goes into an abstract and 
introduction
-Include more citations
