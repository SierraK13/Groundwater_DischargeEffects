One of the most valuable resources in need of protection is our global freshwater supply. In areas such as Mammoth Lakes California where this study is based, effects of climate change can be quantified and compared to groundwater sources and surface water discharge where inferences on the trajectory of our water supply can be predicted. This report in conjunction with others highlights the lesser-known linkages between climate variability, hydrogeology, and hydrologic regimes (Burak 2015). Identifying correlations between these aspects create a space to acknowledge the need to better conserve water sources either through restoration, management, or policy changes. "],["introduction.html", "2 Introduction 2.1 Research Question", " 2 Introduction Within recent decades groundwater research has increased in significance due to its influential interactions with surface water. The understanding of the exchanges between groundwater and surface water has also gained popularity due to the effects on the global freshwater supply. Groundwater and surface water (GW, SW) are not independent sources but rather influential systems that affects several hydrologic characteristics such as baseflow and recharge. Like any other process, the hydrologic cycle is effected by outside factors. The term hydrogeologic environment coined by hydrogeologist J.TÃ³th denotes the need to acknowledge the effects of topography, geology, and climate to further understand GW and SW interactions (Sophocleous 2002). Previous research has often defined base flows of surface water systems to be sourced by upstream groundwater storage (Brutsaert 2008). With this reference, benefits from looking at global changes in temperature and precipitation include ways to predict groundwater levels and their impacts on surface water discharge thus showing the influence on the overall water budget and its reactions to global climate change (Huntington and Niswonger 2012). As anthropogenic effects become more notable in nature it raises a need to understand GW and SW exchanges to protect one of our most valuable resources. With activities such as mining and contaminated runoff it is valuable to quantify flows between GW and SW to help mitigate damage to the riparian area and decrease harm to organisms who may ingest contaminated water (Kalbus, Reinstorf, and Schirmer 2006). Further studies of the lag between groundwater and surface water would also prove to be beneficial in predicting future water supply trends. The benefits of prioritizing groundwater as a renewable water resource would be worthwhile even if its effects are not quickly seen (Green et al. 2011). By conducting research in areas where climate affects the water cycle it is presumed that predictions of how water sources will change in upcoming years can be made. 2.1 Research Question How are groundwater levels affected by climate variables such as temperature and precipitation? Will the climate change trends alter the relationship between groundwater and surface water discharge during baseflow months along Hot Creek near Mammoth Lakes, California? "],["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Site Description 3.2 Analysis Methods 3.3 Watershed Delineation", " 3 Methods 3.1 Site Description For this report, a more in-depth analysis of how climate change impacts the interactions between groundwater and surface water will be reviewed at stations near Mammoth Lakes California along Hot Creek. This site allows for water movement to be monitored under the assumptions that groundwater, due to various factors will later re-emerge into terrestrial water downstream of the groundwater source or aquifer (Kalbus, Reinstorf, and Schirmer 2006). Mammoth Lakes has a coincidental setup to show the process of water transfer between GW and SW due to a grouping of groundwater monitors upstream of a surface water monitor along Hot Creek, however only one near the surface water monitor will be analyzed in this report. Mammoth Lakes is at 7,880 feet in elevation with soils of low infiltration and located in a predominantly Mediterranean climate. This particular site where factors such as climate, temperature, groundwater levels and discharge can be monitored will allow this analysis to compare climate changes to groundwater and surface water quantities. 3.2 Analysis Methods Since this report was multifaceted many types of data were needed to be collected. Data for groundwater and surface water were pulled from USGS monitors and the climate data was retrieved from the USGS climate dashboard. The data was filtered to only obtain groundwater depth in feet, surface water discharge in cubic feet per second, temperature in Fahrenheit, and precipitation in millimeters starting on January 19, 1992, to April 6, 2022. General trends for groundwater levels and surface water discharge rates are to be analyzed on their own and then by adjusting scales the two variables were compared on the same graph to show relations between the two attributes. Once there was a general understanding of the GW and SW relation the climate variables were introduced. Temperature and precipitation were graphed together to show their correlation and allow for other interpretations to be made. Temperature and precipitation were then compared to groundwater depths to show trends between changing climate variables and the variability of the water table. To further analyze how surface discharge is affected the baseflow months of July through October were compared to show ranges of discharge and infer types of water sources that caused large or minor ranges between the months. While some trends were evident in the figures it was important to objectify those relations by using statistical tests to quantify the correlations. Non-parametric tests such as the Mann-Kendall and Sens Slope were used to greater support or contradict assumptions made from the figures. These tests also denoted the strength of the relationship between the various variables. These tests were used to analyze the significance of surface water and groundwater changes. The test also quantified the correlation between groundwater and surface water, the baseflow ranges, and temperature changes throughout the study period. 3.3 Watershed Delineation mapviewOptions(fgb = FALSE) site_coords_CA1 &lt;- readNWISsite(&quot;10265150&quot;) %&gt;% st_as_sf(coords = c(&#39;dec_long_va&#39;, &#39;dec_lat_va&#39;), remove= FALSE, crs = 4326) %&gt;% st_transform(crs = 4269) CAwatershed &lt;- st_read(&#39;MammothCA.geojson&#39;) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(id== &#39;globalwatershed&#39;) ## Reading layer `MammothCA&#39; from data source ## `C:\\Users\\sklem\\Documents\\Independent Study WR-440\\Groundwater_DischargeEffects\\MammothCA.geojson&#39; ## using driver `GeoJSON&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 2 features and 1 field ## Geometry type: GEOMETRY ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: -119.0366 ymin: 37.54841 xmax: -118.8169 ymax: 37.70099 ## Geodetic CRS: WGS 84 mapview(CAwatershed) + mapview(site_coords_CA1) The delineated watershed shows the area where Hot Creek receives its water inputs.

Groundwater depths near Mammoth Lakes, California have been progressively getting deeper since 1992. The graph shows the greatest trending decline was between 2000 and 2003. There is one trend after 2006 that shows an increase in the water table but after that spike in ground water recharge the depth goes down again significantly. Overall there is a positive relationship between ground water depths and time.

Discharge is influenced by many outside sources. The outputs along Hot Creek range from 30 cubic feet per second (cfs) to a little over 300 cfs. With the exception of the occasional spikes around 300 cfs the river shows a decreasing trend in annual ranges of discharge. 4.3 Attribute Analysis GW and SW sw_gw &lt;- left_join(gw_depth, q_ca, by = &quot;Date&quot;) sw_gw_graph &lt;- ggplot() + geom_line(data = sw_gw, aes(x=Date, y=water_depth*3), color = &#39;slateblue2&#39;) + geom_line(data = sw_gw, aes(x=Date, y=q_cfs), color = &#39;paleturquoise&#39;) sw_gw_graph + scale_y_continuous(name = &quot;Dicharge (cfs)&quot; , sec.axis = sec_axis(trans=~./3 , name= &quot;Groundwater Depth (feet)&quot;)) + theme_bw() + xlab(&quot;Date&quot;) Figure 4.3: Here a logistical comparison of groundwater and surface water discharge trends are shown for water years 1992 to 2022. Comparing ground water depths and surface water discharge rates can help show how surface water can be affected by ground water levels.

The data is the same time frame as the ground water and surfacewater data starting in 1992 to 2022. This graph compares the trends of temperature and precipitation over the studied time frame. The temperature has a consistent pattern with no major spikes in either decreasing or increasing temperatures, however it can be noted that there is a general upward trend in the temperature data. Precipitation is much more variable and has significant ranges over the years. Looking at the graph some correlation between the two variables can be seen where there is a dip in temperature precipitation shows a rise and when there is an increase in temperature there is a significant decrease in precipitation such as the section of data between 2010 and 2015.

Comparing the two variable against the water table level allows for a relationship to be interpreted. Based on the graphs there is allegedly a positive trend between temperature and ground water with some outlying points. Water depth is shown to be increasing as temperature also increases. Precipitation and ground water do not show any distinct trends from the graph so a statistical analysis will be needed to better understand the relation. The extreme points on the precipitation graph do show some assumptions of when there is high amounts of precipitation the ground water depth is less and when there is minimal precipitation the water table depth tends to be deeper.

Here the diffrence between monthly discharge is shown. Baseflow discharge rates are generally supported by ground water sources. The graph shows a typical monthly trend where surface water discharges decreases in months further away from snow melt and summer rain storms. The latest month of October never surpasses 70 cfs but July has an extremely wide range of discharge values over the study period. Overall the earlier months have higher discharge values than the later months. Some years there are significant differences between each of the months such as the data from around 1995 and other years there is a minimal change in discharge between the baseflow months such as the data around 2020.

To compare groundwater with discharge during baseflow months the averages for groundwater for the months of July - October are shown.Throughout the years in this study it is seen that groundwater during baseflow months has progressively been getting deeper.

By showing this baseflow month, it allows for a more refined analysis of the relationship. From the baseflow months it seems there were correlations between grounDwater and discharge particularly in the month of October. On the ground water versus discharge graph for October it is noticeable that water tables closer to the surface result in greater discharge values and as groundwater gets deeper the discharge decreases. In this graph it also shows the trend that over the years it is more common to see deeper water tables and less discharge in the Hot Creek stream. 4.4 Statistical Trend Analysis #Surface Water Discharge mk.test(log10(q_month_means$q_mean)) ## ## Mann-Kendall trend test ## ## data: log10(q_month_means$q_mean) ## z = -5.3174, n = 362, p-value = 1.053e-07 ## alternative hypothesis: true S is not equal to 0 ## sample estimates: ## S varS tau ## -1.223400e+04 5.292618e+06 -1.872374e-01 sens.slope(q_month_means$q_mean) ## ## Sen&#39;s slope ## ## data: q_month_means$q_mean ## z = -5.3174, n = 362, p-value = 1.053e-07 ## alternative hypothesis: true z is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.05192506 -0.02444720 ## sample estimates: ## Sen&#39;s slope ## -0.03807232 #Ground Water Level mk.test(log10(gw_depth$water_depth)) ## ## Mann-Kendall trend test ## ## data: log10(gw_depth$water_depth) ## z = 91.388, n = 10395, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true S is not equal to 0 ## sample estimates: ## S varS tau ## 3.228767e+07 1.248222e+11 5.980977e-01 sens.slope(gw_depth$water_depth) ## ## Sen&#39;s slope ## ## data: gw_depth$water_depth ## z = 91.388, n = 10395, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true z is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.0002752903 0.0002838531 ## sample estimates: ## Sen&#39;s slope ## 0.0002796025 #Baseflow months discharge trends mk.test(log10(q_base$q_mean)) ## ## Mann-Kendall trend test ## ## data: log10(q_base$q_mean) ## z = -4.042, n = 120, p-value = 5.299e-05 ## alternative hypothesis: true S is not equal to 0 ## sample estimates: ## S varS tau ## -1.783000e+03 1.943657e+05 -2.497374e-01 sens.slope(q_base$q_mean) ## ## Sen&#39;s slope ## ## data: q_base$q_mean ## z = -4.042, n = 120, p-value = 5.299e-05 ## alternative hypothesis: true z is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.27005610 -0.09705882 ## sample estimates: ## Sen&#39;s slope ## -0.1851216 #Baseflow months groundwater depths mk.test(log10(gw_base$water_depth)) ## ## Mann-Kendall trend test ## ## data: log10(gw_base$water_depth) ## z = 9.8282, n = 116, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true S is not equal to 0 ## sample estimates: ## S varS tau ## 4.120000e+03 1.756433e+05 6.176912e-01 sens.slope(gw_base$water_depth) ## ## Sen&#39;s slope ## ## data: gw_base$water_depth ## z = 9.8282, n = 116, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true z is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.02282677 0.03067001 ## sample estimates: ## Sen&#39;s slope ## 0.02665665 #Temperature t_test &lt;- gw_tp_annual %&gt;% select(-Precip) test &lt;- t_test %&gt;% filter(year &lt;2018) mk.test(log10(test$Avrg_T)) ## ## Mann-Kendall trend test ## ## data: log10(test$Avrg_T) ## z = 1.1902, n = 26, p-value = 0.234 ## alternative hypothesis: true S is not equal to 0 ## sample estimates: ## S varS tau ## 55.0000000 2058.3333333 0.1692308 sens.slope(test$Avrg_T) ## ## Sen&#39;s slope ## ## data: test$Avrg_T ## z = 1.1902, n = 26, p-value = 0.234 ## alternative hypothesis: true z is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.0230378 0.1201857 ## sample estimates: ## Sen&#39;s slope ## 0.04791318 Using a non-parametric statistical test such as the Mann-Kendall showed which variables were significantly changing and then using the Sens Slope test identified what type of trend the parameter was experiencing. For the analysis parameters tested included surface water monthly averages and baseflow (July-October) monthly averages from 1992 to 2022. Also tested was groundwater depth trends and temperature for the same time period 1992 to 2022. After running the tests it was found that monthly surface water discharge rates were significant with a p-value of 1.1e-07 and a slope of -0.038. Baseflow months also had a significant p-value of 5.3e-05 with a negative trending slope of -0.19. The tests on groundwater levels were significant but to a minuscule degree. The p-value was less than 2.2e-16 with a positive slope of 0.00028. Temperature was the only parameter to give insignificant results with a p-value of 0.23 and a slope of 0.048. "],["discussion.html", "5 Discussion", " 5 Discussion With an ever-changing climate, water becomes quite a big deal in a lot of conversations. Previous work by Justin hintington supports the claim that all components of the water budget are in some way affected by temperature and precipitation.(Huntington and Niswonger 2012) The goal of this report was to further prove this statement, showing how changing climate variables such as temperature and precipitation cause a noticeable effect on groundwater levels and its relation to surface water baseflow discharge rates. Using the Hot Creek site near Mammoths Lake, California all four variables were able to be measured and compared objectively. From this report figures 4.1 and 4.2 showed the trends of groundwater and surface water discharge from 1992 to 2022. From these graphs, there are evident positive trends in the groundwater data showing that over time the water table is getting deeper. This trend was proven by the Sens Slope test where groundwater was found to have a slope of 0.0003. When referring to groundwater a positive value translates to a deepening of the water table. While this slope is gradual it is in fact seen to be very significant for groundwater. For only a 30 year time period groundwater in the Mammoth Lakes area dropped by 4.43 feet, if this trend was to continue it could be detrimental to the groundwater supply. The surface water discharge did not have the same obvious effects of a declining trend but overall there is a decrease in discharge rates of 0.03 cubic feet per year. With this general understanding of the types of trends for water supply along Hot Creek, the climate variables were then analyzed to correlate their effects. Temperature and precipitation were also analyzed for their trends before being compared for their effects on the water sources. Figure 4.4 shows the patterns of temperature and precipitation from 1992 to 2017. From this visual, it is interpreted that temperature and precipitation correlate in the way that when temperature increases, precipitation decreases, and the opposite is true. From this, we can further correlate how these attributes affect water through evaporation and groundwater recharge potentials. After this initial analysis of the individual components, their relationships were then quantified. How groundwater is affected by precipitation and temperature was the main relationship in consideration for this analysis. Figure 4.5 shows groundwater compared to temperature and precipitation. By comparing groundwater to the climate characteristics, further analysis on what types of trends can be predicted in times of climate change. Temperature showed to have a more significant relationship with groundwater depths. Having proven that temperature affects precipitation it is given that temperature has a stronger pull on water supply. Temperature affects water through evaporation, recharge possibilities, and water needs for population use. The final comparison was to explore how these factors affect baseflow discharge knowing the strongest influences from groundwater on surface water discharge is during baseflow (Kalbus, Reinstorf, and Schirmer 2006). Figure 4.6 shows discharge for baseflow months with a variation of years where the months have little range and other years where there are major differences in July and October. When comparing these trends to baseflow months of groundwater depths, figure 4.7, it becomes apparent that there is not much overlap but when looking at the end of the study time, possible correlations are seen in October. Figure 4.8 shows groundwater depth and discharge for October and a noticeable trend is seen in how discharge decreases with an increasing water table depth, especially as time goes on. The lighter points representing later years show a significant increasing trend that water depths are getting deeper and discharge is decreasing. These results indicate significant changes in groundwater and surface water discharge. "],["conclusion.html", "6 Conclusion", " 6 Conclusion When looking back to the temperature and precipitation graphs there is more variation in patterns within the past 10 years. From this understanding, it is reasonable to correlate the steadily decreasing measurements of discharge and groundwater depth is caused by the influences of changing climate patterns. This location allowed for these conclusions to be deciphered but research at a larger scale with more evidence that the groundwater from the upstream site was truly resurfacing at the surface water site would strengthen these findings. It is with certainty that climate patterns in the Mammoth Lakes area are positively trending and that there is more to be said about its direct influence on baseflow patterns. In the end, this report supports the need to collect greater amounts of evidence on groundwater and how it deserves more attention for future cases to show its pertinence in the global water supply. Learning how to manage and conserve both groundwater and surface water sources will benefit generations to come and help guarantee a better understanding of the water budget to predict future trends.
