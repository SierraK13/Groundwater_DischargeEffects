This site allows for water movement to be monitored due to the assumptions that groundwater due to various factors will later re-emerge into terrestrial water downstream of the groundwater source or aquifer (Kalbus, Reinstorf, and Schirmer 2006). Mammoth Lakes has a coincidental set up to show the process of water transfer between GW and SW due to a grouping of ground water monitors upstream of a surface water monitor along Hot Creek. Mammoth Lakes is at 7,880 feet in elevation with soils of low infiltration and located in a pre-dominantly Mediterranean climate [web soil &amp; plantmaps]. This particular site where factors such as climate, temperature, groundwater levels, and discharge can be monitored will allow this analysis to compare climate changes to groundwater and surface water quantities. 1.2 Analysis Methods Since this report was multifaceted there were many types of data that needed to be collected. Data for groundwater and surface water were pulled from USGS monitors and the climate data was retrieved from (uh??) The data was filtered to only obtain ground water depth in feet, surface water discharge in cubic feet per second, temperature in Fahrenheit, and precipitation in millimeters starting on January 19, 1992 to April 6, 2022. General trends for groundwater levels and surface water discharge rates to analyze on their own and then by adjusting scales the two variable were compared on the same graph to show any relations between the two attributes. Once there was a general understanding of the GW and SW relation the climate variables were introduced. Temperature and precipitation were graphed together to show their correlation and allow for other interpretations to be made. Temperature and precipitation were then compared to ground water depths to show trends between changing climate variables and the variability of the water table. To further analyze how surface discharge is affected the baseflow moths of July through October were compared to show ranges of discharge and infer water sources for the causes of large or minimal ranges between the months. While some trends were evident through the figures it was important to objectify those relations by using statistical test to quantify the correlations. Non-parametric tests such as the Mann-Kendall and Sens Slope were used to greater support or contradict assumptions made from the figures. These tests also denoted the strength of the relationship between the various variables. These tests were used to analyze the significance of surface water and ground water changes, the correlation between groundwater and surface water, the baseflow ranges, and temperature changes throughout the study period.

The graph shows the greatest decline happening between 2000 and 200??. There is one trend after 2005?? that shows an increase in the water table but after that spike in ground water recharge the depth goes down again significantly. Overall there is a positive relationship between ground water depths and time.

Discharge is influenced by many outside sources. The outputs along Hot Creek range from 30 cubic feet per second (cfs) to a little over 300 cfs.

Comparing ground water depths and surface water discharge rates can help show how surface water can be affected by ground water levels. The double y-axis allows the two variable to be compared by annual averages. The two variables are on different scales but a small correlation can be seen between increasing water table levels and discharge peaks.

The data is the same time frame as the ground water and surfacewater data starting in 1992 to 2022. #how to put in legend This graph compares the trends of temperature and precipitation over the studied time frame. The temperature has a consitent pattern with no major spikes in either decreasing or increasing temperatures, however it can be noted that there is a general upward trend in the temperature data. Precipitation is much more variable and has significant ranges over the years. Looking at the graph some correlation between the two variables can be seen where there is a dip in temperature precipitation shows and rise and when there is an increase in temperature there is a significant decrease in precipitation such as the section of data between 2010 and 2015. #Look at data why is it a sharp decline at end of graph GW, Temp, Precip gw_annual &lt;- gw_depth %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(month = month(Date), year = year(Date)) %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% summarize(water_depth = mean(water_depth, na.rm = T)) gw_tp_annual &lt;- left_join(gw_annual, t_p_annual) layout(matrix(c(1,2), 1, 2, byrow = TRUE)) + plot(gw_tp_annual$water_depth, gw_tp_annual$Avrg_T, col=&quot;lightsalmon3&quot;, pch = 16, main=&quot;Temperature&quot;, ylab = &quot;Average Temperature (F)&quot;, xlab = &quot;Water Depth (ft)&quot;) + plot(gw_tp_annual$water_depth, gw_tp_annual$Precip, col=&quot;darkslategray2&quot;, pch = 16, main=&quot;Precipitation&quot;, xlab = &quot;Water Depth (ft)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Precipitation (mm)&quot;) Figure 2.5: Ground water levels compared to temperature and precipitation climate variables. ## integer(0) #can interpret affects of t and p and then make prediction of how these variables affect GW and correlate that to the relation between gw and sw #could have made a graph with double axis of t p gw Ground water recharge is dependent on many factors but two climate variable that can influence ground water depth is temperature and precipitation. Comparing the two variable against the water table level allows for a relationship to be interpreted. Based on the graphs there is allegedly a positive trend between temperature and ground water with some outlying points. Water depth is shown to be increasing as temperature also increases. Precipitation and ground water do not show any distinct trends from the graph so a statistical analysis will be needed to better understand the relation. The extreme points on the precipitation graph do show some assumptions of when there is high amounts of precipitation the ground water depth is less and when there is minimal precipitation the water table depth tends to be deeper. Monthly Water Trends Discharge Trends for baseflow months #how to edit legend!! q_base &lt;- q_month_means %&gt;% filter(month %in% c(&#39;7&#39;,&#39;8&#39;,&#39;9&#39;,&#39;10&#39;)) ggplot(q_base, aes( x= year, y= q_mean)) + geom_point(aes(color = factor(month))) + scale_y_log10() + ylab(&#39;Q (cfs)&#39;) + xlab(&#39;Water Year&#39;)+ scale_color_discrete() Figure 2.6: Baseflow is represented by the months between July and October. Here the diffrence between monthly discharge is shown. #shows variability between baseflow months over years, sometimes similar other times big difference between july and october Baseflow discharge rates are generally supported by ground water sources. The graph shows a typical monthly trend where surface water discharges decreases in months further away from snow melt and summer rain storms. The latest month of October never surpasses 70 cfs but July has an extremely wide range of discharge values over the study period. Overall the earlier months have higher discharge values than the later months. Some years there are significant differences between each of the months such as the data from around 1995 and other years there is a minimal change in discharge between the baseflow months such as the data around 2020. 2.4 Statistical Trend Analysis #Surface Water Discharge mk.test(log10(q_month_means$q_mean)) ## ## Mann-Kendall trend test ## ## data: log10(q_month_means$q_mean) ## z = -5.3174, n = 362, p-value = 1.053e-07 ## alternative hypothesis: true S is not equal to 0 ## sample estimates: ## S varS tau ## -1.223400e+04 5.292618e+06 -1.872374e-01 sens.slope(q_month_means$q_mean) ## ## Sen&#39;s slope ## ## data: q_month_means$q_mean ## z = -5.3174, n = 362, p-value = 1.053e-07 ## alternative hypothesis: true z is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.05192506 -0.02444720 ## sample estimates: ## Sen&#39;s slope ## -0.03807232 #Ground Water Level mk.test(log10(gw_depth$water_depth)) ## ## Mann-Kendall trend test ## ## data: log10(gw_depth$water_depth) ## z = 91.388, n = 10395, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true S is not equal to 0 ## sample estimates: ## S varS tau ## 3.228767e+07 1.248222e+11 5.980977e-01 sens.slope(gw_depth$water_depth) ## ## Sen&#39;s slope ## ## data: gw_depth$water_depth ## z = 91.388, n = 10395, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true z is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.0002752903 0.0002838531 ## sample estimates: ## Sen&#39;s slope ## 0.0002796025 #Baseflow month trends mk.test(log10(q_base$q_mean)) ## ## Mann-Kendall trend test ## ## data: log10(q_base$q_mean) ## z = -4.042, n = 120, p-value = 5.299e-05 ## alternative hypothesis: true S is not equal to 0 ## sample estimates: ## S varS tau ## -1.783000e+03 1.943657e+05 -2.497374e-01 sens.slope(q_base$q_mean) ## ## Sen&#39;s slope ## ## data: q_base$q_mean ## z = -4.042, n = 120, p-value = 5.299e-05 ## alternative hypothesis: true z is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.27005610 -0.09705882 ## sample estimates: ## Sen&#39;s slope ## -0.1851216 #Temperature t_test &lt;- gw_tp_annual %&gt;% select(-Precip) test &lt;- t_test %&gt;% filter(year &lt;2018) mk.test(log10(test$Avrg_T)) ## ## Mann-Kendall trend test ## ## data: log10(test$Avrg_T) ## z = 1.1902, n = 26, p-value = 0.234 ## alternative hypothesis: true S is not equal to 0 ## sample estimates: ## S varS tau ## 55.0000000 2058.3333333 0.1692308 sens.slope(test$Avrg_T) ## ## Sen&#39;s slope ## ## data: test$Avrg_T ## z = 1.1902, n = 26, p-value = 0.234 ## alternative hypothesis: true z is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.0230378 0.1201857 ## sample estimates: ## Sen&#39;s slope ## 0.04791318 #not signigicant change of increasing temp by 0.05 degrees each year Using a non-parametric statistical test such as the Mann-Kendall showed which variables were significantly changing and then using the Sens Slope test identified what type of trend the parameter was experiencing. For the analysis parameters tested included surface water monthly averages and baseflow (July-October) monthly averages from 1992 to 2022. Also tested was groundwater depth trends and temperature for the same time period 1992 to 2022. After running the tests it was found that monthly surface water discharge rates were significant with a p-value of 1.1e-07 and a slope of -0.038. Baseflow months also had a significant p-value of 5.3e-05 with a negative trending slope of -0.19. The tests on groundwater levels were significant but to a minuscule degree. The p-value was less than 2.2e-16 with a positive slope of 0.00028. Temperature was the only parameter to give insignificant results with a p-value of 0.23 and a slope of 0.048. Ground water results stuff interpreting this positive relationship however it means that the ground water depths are getting deeper and are actually losing water. SW discharge According to the discharge values from the graph above it can be inferred that this is a moderate stream but is on average a smaller stream GW and SW Groundwater has proven to affect surface water discharge levels. During baseflows it is known that ground water can be a continuous source when there is less precipitation events. T &amp; P Climate attributes are known to vary and have affects on ground water levels and surface water discharge rates. Temperature and precipitation have correlate to GW and SW because of theyre influence on processes such as water recharge amounts and evaporation. T&amp;P&amp;GW By comparing ground water to these climate characteristics there can be further analysis on what types of trends can be predicted in times of climate change. monthly Q The differences in potentials between a low flowing stream and groundwater allows for groundwater to rise back up into the stream.
