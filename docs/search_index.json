The understanding of the exchanges between groundwater and surface water has also gained popularity due to the effects on the global fresh water supply. Groundwater and surface water (GW, SW) are not independent sources but rather influential systems that effects several hydrologic characteristics such as baseflow and recharge. As any other process, the hydrologic cycle is effected by outside factors. The term hydrogeologic environment coined by hydrogeologist J.TÃ³th denotes the need to acknowledge the effects of topography, geology, and climate to further understand GW and SW interaction (Sophocleous 2002). Previous research has often defined base flows of surface water systems to be sourced by upstream ground water storages (Brutsaert 2008). With this reference, benefits from looking at global changes in temperature and precipitation include ways to predict ground water levels impacts on surface water discharge and how the overall water budget is being effected by global climate change (Huntington and Niswonger 2012). As anthropogenic effects become more notable in nature it raises a need to understand GW and SW exchanges in order to protect one of our most valuable resources. With activities such as mining and contaminated runoff it is valuable to quantify flows between GW and SW to help mitigate damage to the riparian area and decrease harm to organisms who may ingest contaminated water (Kalbus, Reinstorf, and Schirmer 2006). Further studies of the lag 1.1 Research Question How is climate change affecting ground water levels that can influence base flows in surface water discharge along Hot Creek near Mammoth Lakes, California? Specifically, the attributes in consideration are temperature, precipitation, ground water depth, and surface water discharge raters. "],["methods.html", "2 Methods 2.1 Site Description 2.2 Watershed Delineation", " 2 Methods 2.1 Site Description For this report, a more in depth analysis of how climate change impacts the interactions between ground water and surface water will be reviewed at stations near Mammoth Lakes California along Hot Creek. This site allows for water movement to be monitored due to the assumptions that groundwater due to various factors will later re-emerge into terrestrial water downstream of the groundwater source or aquifer (Kalbus, Reinstorf, and Schirmer 2006). Mammoth Lakes has a coincidental set up to show the process of water transfer between GW and SW due to a grouping of ground water monitors upstream of a surface water monitor along Hot Creek. Mammoth Lakes is at 7,880 feet in elevation with soils of low infiltration and located in a pre-dominantly Mediterranean climate [web soil &amp; plantmaps]. This particular site where factors such as climate, temperature, groundwater levels, and discharge can be monitored will allow this analysis to compare climate changes to groundwater and surface water quantities. 2.2 Watershed Delineation mapviewOptions(fgb = FALSE) site_coords_CA1 &lt;- readNWISsite(&quot;10265150&quot;) %&gt;% st_as_sf(coords = c(&#39;dec_long_va&#39;, &#39;dec_lat_va&#39;), remove= FALSE, crs = 4326) %&gt;% st_transform(crs = 4269) CAwatershed &lt;- st_read(&#39;MammothCA.geojson&#39;) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(id== &#39;globalwatershed&#39;) ## Reading layer `MammothCA&#39; from data source ## `C:\\Users\\sklem\\Documents\\Independent Study WR-440\\Groundwater_DischargeEffects\\MammothCA.geojson&#39; ## using driver `GeoJSON&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 2 features and 1 field ## Geometry type: GEOMETRY ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: -119.0366 ymin: 37.54841 xmax: -118.8169 ymax: 37.70099 ## Geodetic CRS: WGS 84 mapview(CAwatershed) + mapview(site_coords_CA1) "],["results.html", "3 Results 3.1 Data Acquisition 3.2 Attribute Analysis 3.3 Statistical Trend Analysis 3.4 Annual Temperature", " 3 Results 3.1 Data Acquisition ##Surface water discharge data site_ca &lt;- &quot;10265150&quot; q_ca &lt;- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = site_ca, parameterCd = &#39;00060&#39;, startDate = &#39;1992-01-19&#39;, endDate = &#39;2022-04-06&#39;) %&gt;% rename(q_cfs = X_00060_00003) %&gt;% addWaterYear(.) %&gt;% select(-agency_cd, -X_00060_00003_cd) %&gt;% mutate(Site = &quot;Hot CA Flume SW&quot;) %&gt;% select(-site_no) ##Ground water data gw_depth &lt;- read_csv(&#39;gw_data.csv&#39;) ## Rows: 10395 Columns: 3 ## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------------------- ## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot; ## dbl (2): site, water_depth ## date (1): Date ## ## i Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ## i Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message. gw_depth &lt;- gw_depth %&gt;% mutate(Site = &quot;Hot Creek GW&quot;) %&gt;% select(-site) ##Climate Data mam_climate &lt;- read_csv(&#39;Date_Mammoth_climate.csv&#39;) ## Rows: 9133 Columns: 3 ## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------------------- ## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot; ## dbl (2): Avrg_T, Precip ## date (1): Date ## ## i Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ## i Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message. 3.2 Attribute Analysis Groundwater Depth ggplot(gw_depth, aes(x = Date, y = water_depth)) + geom_line() + ylab(&#39;Ground Water Depth (feet)&#39;) + theme_bw() Surface Water Discharge ggplot(q_ca, aes(x = Date, y = q_cfs)) + geom_line() + ylab(&#39;Q (cfs)&#39;) + theme_bw() GW and SW Long sw_gw &lt;- left_join(gw_depth, q_ca, by = &quot;Date&quot;) sw_gw_graph &lt;- ggplot() + geom_line(data = sw_gw, aes(x=Date, y=water_depth*3), color = &#39;grey&#39;) + geom_line(data = sw_gw, aes(x=Date, y=q_cfs), color = &#39;lightblue&#39;) sw_gw_graph + scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~./3)) + theme_bw() + ylab(&quot;GW Depth(F)&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Date&quot;) ## Warning: Removed 1 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path).
