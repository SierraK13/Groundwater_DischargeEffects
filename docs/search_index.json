The understanding of these two water sources has also gained popularity because of their representation of the global fresh water supply. Groundwater and surface water (GW, SW) are not independent sources but rather influential systems that effects several hydrologic characteristics such as baseflow and recharge. Such as any other process, the hydrologic cycle is effected by outside factors. The term hydrogeologic environment coined by hydrogeologist J.TÃ³th denotes the need to acknowledge the effects of topography, geology, and climate to further understand GW and SW interaction (Sophocleous 2002). Previous research has often defined base flows of surface water systems to be sourced by upstream ground water storages (Brutsaert 2008). With this reference, benefits from looking at global changes in temperature and precipitation include ways to predict ground water levels impacts on surface water discharge and how the overall water budget is being effected by global climate change [huntington_role_2012]. 1.1 Research Question How is climate change affecting ground water levels that can influence base flows in surface water discharge along Hot Creek near Mammoth Lakes, California? "],["methods.html", "2 Methods 2.1 Site Description 2.2 Watershed Delineation 2.3 Data Acquisition 2.4 Data Description 2.5 Data Plots", " 2 Methods 2.1 Site Description For this report a deeper look at the impacts of climate change on the interactions between ground water and surface water will be analyzed at stations near Mammoth Lakes California along Hot Creek. This site seemingly presents the process of water transfer between GW and Sw where there are a grouping of ground water monitors upstream of a surface water monitor along the Hot Creek. Mammoth Lakes is at 7,880 feet in elevation with soils of low infiltration and located in a pre-dominantly Mediterranean climate [web soil &amp; plantmaps]. Annual data from several GW sites and one SW site will help analyze the influences of climate change, ground water, and surface water on attributes such as water table levels and discharge rates. 2.2 Watershed Delineation *** make look better? mapviewOptions(fgb = FALSE) site_coords_CA1 &lt;- readNWISsite(&quot;10265150&quot;) %&gt;% st_as_sf(coords = c(&#39;dec_long_va&#39;, &#39;dec_lat_va&#39;), remove= FALSE, crs = 4326) %&gt;% st_transform(crs = 4269) CAwatershed &lt;- st_read(&#39;MammothCA.geojson&#39;) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(id== &#39;globalwatershed&#39;) ## Reading layer `MammothCA&#39; from data source ## `C:\\Users\\sklem\\Documents\\Independent Study WR-440\\Groundwater_DischargeEffects\\MammothCA.geojson&#39; ## using driver `GeoJSON&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 2 features and 1 field ## Geometry type: GEOMETRY ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: -119.0366 ymin: 37.54841 xmax: -118.8169 ymax: 37.70099 ## Geodetic CRS: WGS 84 mapview(CAwatershed) + mapview(site_coords_CA1) 2.3 Data Acquisition ##Surface water discharge data site_ca &lt;- &quot;10265150&quot; # USGS site number for Hot C A Flume near Mammoth Lakes q_ca &lt;- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = site_ca, parameterCd = &#39;00060&#39;, startDate = &#39;1983-07-07&#39;, endDate = &#39;2021-12-18&#39;) %&gt;% rename(q_cfs = X_00060_00003) ##Ground water data---Still need to figure out how to collect data site_ca_gw &lt;- &quot;373845118574202&quot; # USGS site number for GW gage near Mammoth Lakes depth_1 &lt;- readNWISuv(siteNumbers = site_ca_gw, parameterCd = &#39;72019&#39;, startDate = &#39;2021-01-07&#39;, endDate = &#39;2021-12-18&#39;) %&gt;% rename(waterdepth = X_72019_00000) 2.4 Data Description Describe your discharge data in three ways: When did the record of data start at your site? For discharge the record of data starts on July 10, 1983. When did data record end? The records end on December 17,2021. Are there gaps in the data? The discharge data for the surface water gage is quite complete with consistent daily time steps for all recorded years. The groundwater data however does not have as many data points over the years. This could be due to the fact that groundwater levels do not change dramatically often or if the levels were manually monitored. 2.5 Data Plots Surface Water Discharge ggplot(q_ca, aes(x = Date, y = q_cfs)) + geom_line() + ylab(&#39;Q (cfs)&#39;) Water Table Plot ggplot(depth_1, aes(x = Date, y = waterdepth)) + geom_line() + ylab(&#39;Q (cfs)&#39;) 2.5.1 Interpretation The discharge plot above shows data between 1983 and 2021. Throughout this time period there are several significant spikes with high discharge amounts around 300 cfs. A decreasing pattern seems to have occurred in the last decade with less spikes.

All of these graphs have a general pattern where the highest values occur in May through September. Each month also has a slightly negative trend as the years go on which could correlate to drought conditions in the west. The negative trend is more noticeable in December which is usually the time of baseflows therefore can be subjectively supportive to the decreasing discharge hypothesis. ##Practice ##Plot to compare median and minimum Not sure how to make a nice legend Easier coding to have multiple variables on a graph? ggplot(q_stats, aes(x= year)) + geom_point(aes(y=q_mean), color = &quot;purple&quot;) + geom_point(aes(y=q_min), color = &quot;light blue&quot;) + geom_point(aes(y=q_med), color = &quot; dark green&quot;) + facet_wrap(~month, scales = &#39;free&#39;) + scale_y_log10() + ylab(&quot;Monthly Statistics&quot;) 4.8 Monthly stat comparison of June q_june &lt;- q_stats %&gt;% filter(month == 6) ggplot(q_june, aes(x= year)) + geom_point(aes(y=q_mean), color = &quot;purple&quot;) + geom_point(aes(y=q_min), color = &quot;light blue&quot;) + geom_point(aes(y=q_med), color = &quot; dark green&quot;) + scale_y_log10() + ylab(&quot;Monthly Statistics&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Year&quot;) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
