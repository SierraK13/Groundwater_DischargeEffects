Ground water results stuff

interpreting this positive relationship however it means that the ground water depths
are getting deeper and are actually losing water. 



SW discharge

According to the discharge values
from the graph above it can be inferred that this is a moderate stream but is on
average a smaller stream

GW and SW

Groundwater has proven to affect surface water discharge levels.
During baseflows it is 
known that ground water can be a continuous source when there is less precipitation
events.

T & P

Climate attributes are known to vary and have affects on ground water levels and 
surface water discharge rates.
Temperature and precipitation have correlate to GW and SW because of they're influence on processes such as water 
recharge amounts and evaporation. 

T&P&GW

By comparing ground water to these climate 
characteristics there can be further analysis on what types of trends can be predicted
in times of climate change.

monthly Q

The 
differences in potentials between a low flowing stream and groundwater allows
for groundwater to rise back up into the stream. (Find paper that says this better)
