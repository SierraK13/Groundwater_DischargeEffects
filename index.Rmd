# Question

How is climate change affecting ground water levels that can influence base flows 
in surface water discharge along Hot Creek near Mammoth Lakes, California?


# Abstract

  Within recent decades groundwater research has increased in significance due to 
its significant interactions with surface water. The 
understanding of these two water sources has also gained popularity because of their representation of the global fresh water supply.
Groundwater and surface water (GW, SW) are not independent sources 
but rather influential systems 
that effects several hydrologic characteristics such as baseflow and 
recharge. Such as any other process, the hydrologic cycle is 
effected by outside factors. The term "hydrogeologic environment" 
coined by hydrogeologist J.TÃ³th denotes the need to acknowledge the 
effects of topography, geology, and climate to further understand
GW and SW interaction [@440170]. 
Previous research has often defined base flows of surface water 
systems to be sourced by upstream ground water storage's 
[@brutsaert_long-term_2008]. With this reference, benefits from
looking at global changes in temperature and precipitation include 
ways to predict ground water levels impacts on surface water 
discharge
and how the overall water budget is being effected by global 
climate change [huntington_role_2012]. 

# Background

  For this report a deeper look at the
impacts of climate change on the interactions between ground water
and surface water will 
be analyzed 
at stations near Mammoth Lakes California along Hot Creek. This
site seemingly presents the process of water transfer between
GW and Sw where there are a grouping of ground water monitors 
upstream of a surface water monitor along the Hot Creek. Mammoth
Lakes is at 7,880 feet in elevation with soils of low infiltration
and located in a pre-dominantly Mediterranean climate [web soil & plantmaps].
Annual data from several GW sites and one SW site will help analyze
the influences of climate change, ground water, and surface water
on attributes such as water table levels and discharge rates.
