# Abstract 

  Society as a whole has put attention to conserving our natural resources 
more than ever before due to pressures such as population growth, climate change,
and an increasing interest in recreation. One of the most valuable resources in
need of protection is our global freshwater supply. In areas such as Mammoth
Lakes California where this study is based, effects of climate change can be 
quantified and compared 
to groundwater sources and surface water discharge where inferences on the trajectory
of our water supply can be predicted. This report 
in conjunction with others highlights the lesser-known linkages between
climate variability, hydrogeology, and hydrologic regimes [@burak_climate_2015].
Identifying correlations between these aspects create a space to acknowledge 
the need to better conserve water sources either through restoration, management, 
or policy changes.  



# Introduction 

  Within recent decades groundwater research has increased in significance due to 
its influential interactions with surface water. The 
understanding of the exchanges between groundwater and surface water 
has also gained popularity due to the effects on the global freshwater supply.
Groundwater and surface water (GW, SW) are not independent sources 
but rather influential systems 
that affects several hydrologic characteristics such as baseflow and 
recharge. Like any other process, the hydrologic cycle is 
effected by outside factors. The term "hydrogeologic environment" 
coined by hydrogeologist J.TÃ³th denotes the need to acknowledge the 
effects of topography, geology, and climate to further understand
GW and SW interactions [@sophocleous_interactions_2002]. 
Previous research has often defined base flows of surface water 
systems to be sourced by upstream groundwater storage 
[@brutsaert_long-term_2008]. With this reference, benefits from
looking at global changes in temperature and precipitation include 
ways to predict groundwater levels and their impacts on surface water 
discharge thus showing the influence on the overall water budget and its reactions
to global climate change [@huntington_role_2012].

  As anthropogenic effects become more notable in nature it raises a need 
to understand GW and SW exchanges to protect one of our most valuable
resources. With activities such as mining and contaminated runoff it is valuable 
to quantify flows between GW and SW to help mitigate damage to the riparian area
and decrease harm to organisms who may ingest contaminated water 
[@kalbus_measuring_2006]. Further studies of the lag between groundwater and 
surface water would also prove to be beneficial in predicting future water supply
trends. The benefits of prioritizing groundwater as a renewable water resource 
would be worthwhile even if its effects are not quickly seen [@green_beneath_2011].
By conducting research in areas where climate affects the water cycle it is 
presumed that predictions of how water sources will change in upcoming years
can be made. 


## Research Question

How are groundwater levels affected by climate variables such as temperature and
precipitation? Will the climate change trends alter the relationship between 
groundwater and surface water discharge during baseflow months along Hot Creek near Mammoth Lakes, California?
