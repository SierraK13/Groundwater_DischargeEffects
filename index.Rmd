# Abstract

  Within recent decades groundwater research has increased in significance due to 
its influential interactions with surface water. The 
understanding of the exchanges between groundwater and surface water 
has also gained popularity due to the effects on the global fresh water supply.
Groundwater and surface water (GW, SW) are not independent sources 
but rather influential systems 
that effects several hydrologic characteristics such as baseflow and 
recharge. As any other process, the hydrologic cycle is 
effected by outside factors. The term "hydrogeologic environment" 
coined by hydrogeologist J.TÃ³th denotes the need to acknowledge the 
effects of topography, geology, and climate to further understand
GW and SW interaction [@sophocleous_interactions_2002]. 
Previous research has often defined base flows of surface water 
systems to be sourced by upstream ground water storage's 
[@brutsaert_long-term_2008]. With this reference, benefits from
looking at global changes in temperature and precipitation include 
ways to predict ground water levels impacts on surface water 
discharge and how the overall water budget is being effected by global 
climate change [@huntington_role_2012].

  As anthropogenic effects become more notable in nature it raises a need 
to understand GW and SW exchanges in order to protect one of our most valuable
resources. With activities such as mining and contaminated runoff it is valuable 
to quantify flows between GW and SW to help mitigate damage to the riparian area
and decrease harm to organisms who may ingest contaminated water 
[@kalbus_measuring_2006]. Further studies of the lag 



## Research Question

How is climate change affecting ground water levels that can influence base flows 
in surface water discharge along Hot Creek near Mammoth Lakes, California? Specifically,
the attributes in consideration are temperature, precipitation, ground water 
depth, and surface water discharge raters.
